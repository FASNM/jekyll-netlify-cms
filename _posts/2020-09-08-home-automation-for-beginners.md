Getting started with home automation can be overwhelming in the event that you attempt to jump to full smart-home status immediately. Rather, start little. 

While it might appear to be overwhelming, home automation is in reality entirely possible for beginners. In this post, we stall the fundamentals of home automation for beginners.

**What is Home Automation?** 
-----------------------------

Home automation includes utilizing devices that you program to work naturally and with remote access. In 2019, [53 percent of people in the United States](https://clutch.co/developers/internet-of-things/resources/iot-technology-smart-devices-home) owned at least one smart home device.

Yet, they're just only the start. Smart appliances, mechanical cleaners, outlets, and pet feeders are all available.

Gardens benefit, as well: Automated sprinklers sense how dry your yard is and switch themselves on as needed.
